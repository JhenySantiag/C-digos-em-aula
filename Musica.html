        <p>That feeling that doesn't go away just did <br>
            And I walked a thousand miles to prove it <br>
            And I'm caught in the crossfire of my own thoughts <br>
            The colour of my blood is all I see on the rocks <br>
            As you sail from me. <br>
            <br>

            Alarms will ring for eternity <br>
            The waves will break every chain on me <br>
            My bones will bleach. my flesh will flee. <br>
            So help my lifeless frame to breathe <br>
            <br>

            And god knows I'm not dying but I bleed now <br>
            And god knows It's the only way to heal now <br>
            With all the blood I lost with you <br>
            It drowns the love I thought I knew <br>
            <br>

            The lost dreams I buried in my sleep for him <br>
            And this was the ecstacy of love forgotten <br>
            And I'm thrown in the gunfire of empty bullets <br>
            And my blood is all I see as you steal my soul from me. <br>
            <br>

            Alarms will ring for eternity <br>
            The waves will break every chain on me <br>
            <br>
            And god knows I'm not dying but I bleed now <br>
            And god knows It's the only way to heal now <br>
            With all the blood I lost with you <br>
            It drowns the love I thought I knew <br>
            <br>
            And god knows I'm not dying but I bleed now <br>
            And god knows It's the only way to heal now <br>
            With all the blood I lost with you <br>
            It drowns the love I thought I knew <br>
            <br>
            And god knows I'm not dying but I bleed now <br>
            And god knows It's the only way to heal now <br>
            With all the blood I lost with you <br>
            It drowns the love I thought I knew <br>

        <p>Ever since I was a child<br>
            I've turned it over in my mind<br>
            I sang by that piano, tore my yellow dress and<br>
            Cried and cried and cried<br>
            <br>
            Now to unsee what I've seen<br>
            To undo what has been done<br>
            Turn off all the lights<br>
            Let the morning come
            <br>
            Now there's green light in my eyes<br>
            And my lover on my mind<br>
            And I'll sing from the piano, tear my yellow dress and<br>
            Cry and cry and cry<br>
            Over the love of you<br>
            <br>
            On this champagne, drunken home<br>
            Against the current of gold<br>
            Everybody, see, I love him <br>
            <br>
            Cause it's a feeling that you get<br>
            When the afternoon is set<br>
            On a bridge into the city<br>
            <br>
            And I don't wanna see what I've seen<br>
            To undo what has been done<br>
            Turn off all the lights<br>
            Let the morning come<br>
            <br>
            Now there's green light in my eyes<br>
            And my lover on my mind<br>
            And I'll sing from the piano, tear my yellow dress and<br>
            Cry and cry and cry<br>
            <br>
            Cause you're a hard soul to save<br>
            With an ocean in the way<br>
            But I'll get around it<br>
            I'll get around it<br>
            <br>
            'Cause you're a hard soul to save<br>
            With an ocean in the way<br>
            But I'll get around it<br>

            <br>
            Cry and cry and cry and<br>
            Over the love of you<br>
            <br>
            Cry and cry and cry and<br>
            (I can see the green light)<br>
            (I can see it in your eyes)
            <br>
            Over the love of you<br>
            Cry and cry and cry and cry<br>
            <br>

            I can see the green light, I can see it in your eyes<br>
            I can see the green light, I can see it in your eyes<br>
            I can see the green light, I can see it in your eyes<br>

<p>You got a cold, cold heart<br>
Do you feel it all?<br>
You build a house of cards<br>
But it's gonna fall<br>
<br>
You think I don't see<br>
Who you really are<br>
I got news coming<br>
I've seen it all from the start<br>
<br>
I know all your secrets<br>
I know all your lies<br>
I know where  you keep 'em<br>
Buried deep inside<br>
No you can't hide<br>
Your secrets and lies<br>
Secrets and lies<br>
<br>
Wish on your lucky stars<br>
'Cause it's all you got<br>
Won't get you very far<br>
When the music starts<br>
<br>
You think I don't see<br>
Who you really are<br>
I got news coming<br>
I've seen it all from the start<br>
<br>
I know all your secrets<br>
I know all your lies<br>
I know where  you keep 'em<br>
Buried deep inside<br>
No you can't hide<br>
Your secrets and lies<br>
Your secrets and lies<br>
Your secrets and lies<br><br>
Secrets and lies
<br>
You got a cold, cold heart<br>
You build a house of cards<br>
I know all your secrets<br>
I know all your lies<br>
I know where  you keep 'em<br>
Buried deep inside<br>
No you can't hide <br>
Your secrets and lies</p>
